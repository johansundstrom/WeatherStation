DHT22

* Low cost
* 3 to 5V power and I/O
* 2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)
* Good for 0-100% humidity readings with 2-5% accuracy
* Good for -40 to 125°C temperature readings ±0.5°C accuracy
* No more than 0.5 Hz sampling rate (once every 2 seconds)
* Body size 15.1mm x 25mm x 7.7mm
* The DHTxx has 4 pins (facing the sensor, pin 1 is the most left) 
Pinout
1. VCC (we can connect to external 5V or to 3.3V from NodeMCU);
2. Data out;
3. Not Connected
4. Ground.
* One usually you will use the sensor on distances less than 20m,
* a 10K ohm resistor should be connected between Data and VCC pins. 
The Output pin will be connected to NodeMCU pin D3 (see the diagram above).
